# Level-4 Project â€“ Static Website (HTML Only)

## Overview
This repository contains a simple, clean **singleâ€‘page static website** built with semantic HTML. It demonstrates a classic layout thatâ€™s perfect for practice or small information sites: a header with navigation, a main content area split into a primary section and an aside, and a footer. The navigation links are **internal anchors** that jump to five content blocks (Menu, About, Home, View Website, Exit). This project is intentionally lightweightâ€”no frameworks, no build toolsâ€”so you can focus on learning and improving your HTML structure.

## Features
- Semantic tags: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`
- Anchorâ€‘based navigation to inâ€‘page sections (IDs match nav items)
- Example content that can be replaced with your own text and media
- Minimal setup: open `index.html` directly in a browser
- Ready for GitHub Pages (serve as a simple portfolio/demo page)

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Place your `index.html` in the project root (already provided by you).
3. Doubleâ€‘click `index.html` to preview locally, or use a local server if you prefer.
4. (Optional) Deploy on **GitHub Pages**: push to `main`, then enable Pages in repo settings and select `main` â†’ `/root`.

## Suggested Structure
```
.
â”œâ”€ index.html
â”œâ”€ README.md
â”œâ”€ LICENSE
â””â”€ .gitignore
```
You can add folders like `assets/`, `images/`, or `styles/` later.

## Customization Tips
- Update the `<title>` to match your brand.
- Keep ID values and nav links in sync (e.g., `href="#Menu"` â†” `id="Menu"`).
- Replace placeholder text with real content; consider adding CSS for styling.
- Validate with the W3C HTML validator for best practices.
